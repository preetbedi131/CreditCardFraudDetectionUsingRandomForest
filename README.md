# CreditCardFraudDetectionUsingRandomForest

This project implements a machine learning-based fraud detection system using the Random Forest Classifier. The goal is to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or not, based on transaction features.

The dataset is cleaned (handling missing values, outliers, and multicollinearity), preprocessed, and split into training and testing sets. The trained model is then evaluated using performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
